The creation of this repository was inspired by [Siraj Raval's challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6420525903968825344/) to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for 100 days.
I nervously accepted this challenge in addition to working full time in the 2018 summer semester. I will use this repository to store code, jupyter notebook examples, and thought processes.

## Day 0 : Aug 5 to 6 , 2018 | Challenge Starting peparation 

**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : Aug 7 , 2018 | [Crash course of Data Science and ML with Python](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6432532718810169344/)

**Today's Progress** : I have completed article and code for Crash course of Data Science and ML with Python.

**Thoughts** : It is challenging for Beginners.But i will try easily explain of all things for Crash course of Data Science and ML with Python.

## Day 2 : Aug 8 , 2018 | [Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6432869901274312704)

**Today's Progress** : Today I've spent many hours exploring Exploratory data analysis.It plays a role in the work of data science and machine learning.

**Thoughts** : I am giving a brief intro of Exploratory data analysis(EDA) in Python with help of pandas and matplotlib.And I am using a dataset on Super Store's for this.
